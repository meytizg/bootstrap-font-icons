To use, place the following code just about anywhere:\r\n\r\n ```html\r\n\t<i class=\"icon-search\"></i>\r\n ```\r\n \r\nThere are also styles available for inverted (white) icons, made ready with one extra class:\r\n\r\n ```html\r\n\t<i class=\"icon-search icon-white\"></i>\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n1. Copy the Octions font directory into your project.\r\n2. Copy octicons.css into your project.\r\n3. Open your project's octicons.css and edit the font url to ensure it points to the right place.\r\n4. In the &lt;head&gt; of your html, reference the location to your octicons.css.\r\n ```html\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bootstrap.css\">\r\n\t\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"octicons.css\">\r\n ```\r\n5.
